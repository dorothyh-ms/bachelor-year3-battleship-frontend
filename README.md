This repository contains the Vite + React + Typescript frontend portion of a battleship game as part of the game platform project (backend is in the bachelor-year3-platform-backend repository, frontend is the bachelor-year3-platform-frontend repository). The pipeline at the project root builds the project and then deploys it to Azure Static Web Apps using GitLabâ€™s CI/CD. The deploy stage uses the Azure Static Web Apps deployment image to automatically publish the contents of the dist/ folder whenever changes are merged into the main branch.
